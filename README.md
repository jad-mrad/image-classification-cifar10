# 🖼️ Image Classification with CNN

Deep learning model to classify images into 
10 categories using Convolutional Neural Networks.

## 📊 Results
- **Model:** CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
- **Accuracy:** 77%
- **Dataset:** CIFAR-10 (60,000 images)
- **Categories:** airplane, car, bird, cat, deer, 
  dog, frog, horse, ship, truck

## 🔍 What I learned
1. Loaded and explored image dataset
2. Normalized pixel values (0-255 → 0-1)
3. Built simple Neural Network (47% accuracy)
4. Upgraded to CNN (77% accuracy)
5. Discovered and fixed overfitting with Dropout

## 🛠️ Libraries Used
- TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib
